Our project reveals the topic of graph theory and it is divided in 4 parts.<br>
✅1 part - Introduction of our team members<br>
✅2 part - Graph Theory introduction(types of graph and their characteristics)<br>
✅3 part - Representation of Graph using AdjMatrix and AdjList Graph representations<br>
✅4 part - Application<br><br>

At our presentation, we get acquainted with the program of our project and with each member of our team. We learn: what are graphs, get acquainted with the basic terms. We visually describe and show the types of graphs and their characteristic properties with many examples of their application from real life. 
We also provided implementation code in Java of our 2 graph representations(adjacency matrix, adjacency list). And cover where do we widely use graphs.
